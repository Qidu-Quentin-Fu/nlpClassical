## 1 Introduction 
These repository includes two projects, specifically, these two project aim for the tasks below respectively:
- project1 (logRegressionForSentimentAnalysis): Implement logistic regression from scratch to predict sentiment polarity of Twitter text data
- project2 (naiveBayesForSentimentAnalysis): Implement naive Bayes from scratch to predict sentiment polarity of Twitter text data
- project3 (wordEmbeddings): Implement word2vec from scratch to predict analogies between words
- project4 (naiveMachineTranslationAndLSH): Implement machine translation from scratch using word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing

## 2 Methodology
To complete the aforementioned tasks, my project code files:
- Project 1 ([code file](logRegressionForSentimentAnalysis.py)):
    - clean the Twitter data
    - extract features from the data
    - implement logistic regression from scratch
    - predict sentiment polarity of Twitter text data
    - perform model evaluation
- Project 2 ([code file](naiveBayesForSentimentAnalysis.py)):
    - clean the Twitter data
    - extract features from the data
    - implement naive Bayes from scratch
    - predict sentiment polarity of Twitter text data
    - perform model evaluation
- Project 3 ([code file](wordEmbeddings.py)):
    - clean the Twitter data
    - extract features from the data
    - implement word2vec from scratch
    - predict analogies between words
    - perform model evaluation
- Project 4 ([code file](naiveMachineTranslation.py)):
    - clean the Twitter data
    - extract features from the data
    - implement machine translation from scratch using word embeddings 
    - perform model evaluation

Note that the some helper functions are written in the `utils.py` file. Please refer to the code and utils files for more details.
